  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/):
  _"Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and
  reducing some of the common killers responsible for child and maternal
  mortality._


  _Major progress has also been made on increasing access to clean water and
  sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio and the spread of HIV/AIDS._


  _However, many more efforts are needed to control a wide range of diseases and
  address many different persistent and emerging health issues."_

  The UN has defined 13 _Targets_ and 28 _Indicators_ for SDG 3. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.

<p>While most SDG targets are set for 2030, this is set to be achieved for 2020.  
This is measured relative to 2010 levels as it was defined as part of the <a href="http://www.who.int/roadsafety/decade_of_action/en/">UN Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020)</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the SDG Indicator is the <i>rate</i> of road deaths while the target is set for the <i>absolute number</i> of road deaths. Because of this we show both metrics.</p>
