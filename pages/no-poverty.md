title: End poverty in all its forms everywhere
goalNum: 1
name: No Poverty
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/):
  <q>[Extreme poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty) rates have
  fallen by more than half since 1990. While this is a remarkable achievement,
  one-in-five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.90 a day.
  Millions more make little more than this daily amount and are at risk of
  slipping back into extreme poverty.</q>


  Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG1) aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. The visualizations and data below present the latest data on our progress there.


  Longer-term trends, correlates and additional data on extreme poverty can be found at the _Our World in Data_ entry on [Global Extreme Poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty).


  The UN has defined 7 _Targets_ and 14 _Indicators_ for SDG 1. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.

            <h3>Eradicate extreme poverty</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Indicator 1.1.1 is the <q>proportion of population below the international poverty line, by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural)</q>. <p>The "international poverty line" is defined as $1.90 per day (updated from the previous poverty line of $1.25 to $1.90 in 2015).

This poverty line is measured in "international dollars" which are a hypothetical currency that adjusts for price differences between countries (purchasing power parity) and it is measured in prices of 2011 to adjust for price changes over time (inflation).</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> By 2030 <q>eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.90 a day</q>.</p>
