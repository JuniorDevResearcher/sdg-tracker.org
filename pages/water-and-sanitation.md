title: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all
goalNum: 6
name: Clean Water and Sanitation
description: >-
  The [UN
  explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/):
  _"Clean water is a basic human need, and one that should be easily accessible
  to all. There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this.
  However, due to poor infrastructure, investment and planning, every year
  millions of people — [most of them
  children](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-by-risk-under5s) — die
  from [diseases associated
  with](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-from-diarrheal-diseases-by-age)
  inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene."_


  The charts below summarise progress towards improved water and sanitation access. More details can be found in the _Our World in Data_ entry on [Water Access, Resources and Sanitation](https://ourworldindata.org/water-access-resources-sanitation).


  The UN has defined 8 _Targets_ and 11 _Indicators_ for SDG 6. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
