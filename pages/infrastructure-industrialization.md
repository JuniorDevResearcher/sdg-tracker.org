  Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and

goalNum: 9
name: 'Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure'
description: >-
  The [UN
  explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/infrastructure-industrialization/):
  <q>Investments in infrastructure – transport, irrigation, energy and
  information and communication technology – are crucial to achieving
  sustainable development and empowering communities in many countries. It has
  long been recognized that growth in productivity and incomes, and improvements
  in health and education outcomes require investment in infrastructure.</q>


  The UN has defined 8 _Targets_ and 12 _Indicators_ for SDG 9. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
