title: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
goalNum: 12
name: Responsible Consumption and Production
description: >-
  The [UN
  explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/):
  <q>Sustainable consumption and production is about promoting resource and
  energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, and providing access to basic
  services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. Its
  implementation helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future
  economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic competitiveness
  and reduce poverty.</q>


  Definitions of, and indicators for sustainable resource consumption is
  currently limited, as shown in the data available below.


  The UN has defined 11 _Targets_ and 13 _Indicators_ for SDG 12. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
